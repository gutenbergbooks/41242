<p>The drama here published is logically the third in
a series of racial dramas, as follows:</p>

<ol><li><i>The Saxons</i></li>
<li><i>The Slavs</i></li>
<li><i>The Americans</i></li>
<li><i>The Hindoos</i></li></ol>

<p>Of this series <i>The Saxons</i>, dealing with man's struggle
for religious liberty, has already been published.
For reasons that need not be given, it has been thought
best to postpone <i>The Slavs</i>, which will present man's
battle for political liberty, and offer <i>The Americans</i>,
the theme of which is the industrial conflict that is
now raging. <i>The Hindoos</i>, a drama of spiritual unfoldment,
will come in its order.</p>

<h2><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I">ACT I</a></h2>

<h2><small>THE MINE</small></h2>

<p><i>Scene: On the mountains in a timber region of
north-western America. In every direction, as far as
the eye can see, a wilderness of stumps with piles of
brush black with age and sinking from sheer rottenness
into the ground. Here and there a dead pine
stands up high against the horizon. In the distance,
left, cleaving the range and extending on back under
an horizon of cold gray clouds, is seen the line of a
river of which this whole region is apparently the
watershed, for everywhere the land slopes toward it.
In the remote distance, beyond the river, innumerable
bare buttes, and beyond these a gray stretch of plains.
Down the mountains, left, six or seven miles away,
the river loops in and a portion of a town is seen upon
its banks. At this end of the town, upon a hill overlooking
the river, a large white mansion conspicuous
for the timber about it. At the farther end, a huge
red saw-mill occupies the centre of a vast field of yellow
lumber piles, the tall black stack of the mill
clearly outlined against the gray of the land beyond.</i></p>

<p><i>Back, a hundred yards or so, a road, evidently constructed
years ago when the logs were being taken out,
comes up on the flats from the direction of the town,<span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
turns sharply to the right and goes toward the ridge.
Beyond this road, just at the curve, standing out
among the stumps, an old stationary engine eaten up
with rust and an abandoned logging-wagon, the hind
part resting upon the ground, the two heavy wheels
lying upon it. Farther back a small cabin falling into
decay. Here and there patches of creeping vines and
rank grass cover the ground, hiding in some places to
a considerable depth the bases of the stumps. But to
the left, where it is evident a steep slope plunges down,
and also in the foreground, are open spaces with boulders
and, scattered about under a thin loam of rotted
needles and black cones, the outlines of a few flat
stones. In the immediate foreground, left, a huge
boulder, weighing possibly four or five tons, barely
hangs upon the slope, ready at any moment, one would
think, to slip and plunge down.</i></p>

<p><i>Two men, Cap Saunders and Harvey Anderson, the
latter down left, the former to the right and farther
back, are slowly coming forward. Each has a camping
outfit, a roll of blankets, etc., upon his back, and
carries in his hands a plaster cast of what would seem
to be a cross-section of a log. It is about two feet in
diameter and three inches thick. As they come along
they try the casts on the various stumps and carefully
turn them about to see if they fit, then chip the stump
with a hatchet to indicate that it has been tried.</i></p>

the present time.</i></p><p><span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Presently, about twenty feet up in the rear and
on either side, faint lights begin to appear and
faint sounds of music are heard. Gradually
the lights brighten a little and the sounds of
music become more and more audible until one
becomes conscious that on the left an orchestra
is playing and to the right a piano. One also
becomes conscious of a vast and beautiful hall
over the floor of which, as the music plays, the
forms of dancers are gliding. Occasionally
from here and there flashes a sparkle as of diamonds,
and low rippling laughter is heard. In
the foreground for a space of twelve or fifteen
feet, cut off from the main hall by the faintest
outlines of an immense arch, small groups of
elderly people stand about watching the dancers,<span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
or saunter right and left into the adjoining
apartments. In these apartments also people
are seen moving about, and there is a hum
of voices as of men and women in conversation.
At no time does it become very light, and all
that passes seems to pass in a dim shadow
world.</i></p>

<p><i>It is sufficiently light, however, to enable one
to discern the grotesque richness of the hall
which, as one sees at a glance, is an elaborate
representation of a pine forest, the boles of the
trees standing out in beautiful irregularity
along the walls, the boughs above in the semi-darkness
seeming to disappear in some sort of
cathedral roof. There, all about, singly and in
clusters, innumerable small globes as though
the cones were illuminated. Between the trees,
also in relief and life-sized, figures of men at
work getting out timber. Forward right,
teams dragging logs, and, on the opposite wall,
a distant view of a river with rafts floating
down. Standing on stumps, huge figures support
the arched doorways, of which there is one
in the rear wall right, and one centre in each of
the side walls. Left rear, the grand staircase
with the glow of some hidden lamp shining
upon the landing. Here the carved scene upon
the wall is that of an inclined trestle-work, with
logs going up apparently into some mill above.<span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Below, crouched upon the newel-post and the
lower rail, the carved figure of a large mountain
lion with a frosted light in its open mouth.
Forward from the arched doorway, left, there
is no wall from about four feet up, and through
this open space, faintly illumined by small hidden
lamps, a greenness as of palms and flowers.</i></p>

<p><i>The music ceases and the couples break up.
Later, the piano begins again, and just inside
the main hall Gladys Egerton, in low d√©collet√©

<h2><a name="ACT_II" id="ACT_II">ACT II</a></h2>

<h2><small>THE MILL</small></h2>

<p><i>Scene: A street showing, right, the great lumber
plant of the Egerton Company. Centre, occupying the
greater part of the space between left and right, a sort
of common, overstrewn, as such places usually are,
with sawdust and waste sawings of the mill, extends
back a hundred yards or so to where the river sweeps
in from behind a rising slope on the left and disappears
behind the high fence of the mill-yard on the
right. Across the river, right, the same denuded mountains
as were seen in the preceding Act, and, centre,
the alluvial stretches of the valley widening out into
the plains. Left rear, on this side of the river, a sort
of hill comes in and upon its rather steep slope are
rows of roughly built plank houses which have evidently
been standing many years. They are all of one
design and rest in the rear upon the ground, the front
being propped up on posts, in some cases six or eight
feet high. Of two or three of these shacks it would
seem that the occupants had tried to have a garden, for
here and there are small green patches as of late turnips,
also tall stakes with withered bean vines clinging
to them. From the numerous footpaths that come
down toward the mill-gate it is evident that these<span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
shacks are the homes of the employees of the Egerton
Company. The mill-yard on the right is surrounded
by a high board-fence. New planks have recently been
put in here and there, and on top of the fence, apparently
just strung, are several rows of bright new
barbed wire. Over the top of the fence and through
the open gates of the driveway which is in the corner,
a portion of the latter having been cut off for this purpose,
are seen countless lumber stacks, and beyond
these, far back and facing left, a section of an enormous
mill. Along the comb of the roof, doubtless running
its full length, is a large red sign with white letters of
which one sees only: RTON AND CO.</i></p>

<p><i>Before the entrance to the mill-yard two of the
State militia with rifles upon their shoulders patrol the
property, one of them pacing right and left along the
street in the foreground, the other backwards and forwards
in the open space that goes toward the river.
About twenty feet from the entrance stands a large red
automobile, under which, stretched upon his back, lies
the chauffeur, with his hands up fixing something.</i></p>

<p><i>As the Scene opens, the two sentries, one of them
rolling a cigarette, the other with his gun behind his
head and with his arms hanging over it, stand listening
back toward the mill, where a number of voices
are singing, 'There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town
To-night.' When the song is finished a cheer goes up.</i></p>

<p><i>Time: The afternoon of the next day about four
o'clock.</i></p><p><span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ACT_III" id="ACT_III">ACT III</a></h2>

<h2><small>THE MANSION</small></h2>

<p><i>Scene: The great reception hall in the Egerton
mansion. One sees at a glance that this is the original
of the shadow hall shown in the Dream-Vision in
the First Act. The carved mountain lion crouches
upon the newel-post, and upon the walls the figures of
men at work among the pines are identical with those
of the Vision. But here, seen under a natural light,
the grotesque grandeur of it all stands out in clear relief.
Forward, left and right, just where the great
arch separating the main hall comes down, groups of
little pines in tubs lend a freshness to the scene.</i></p>

<p><i>A brilliant company is gathered. Everywhere, from
gestures and lifted eyes, it is evident that the mansion,
especially the strange scene upon the walls, is the chief
topic of talk among the guests. Centre right, about
the piano, a number of young people are watching a
couple that is out upon the floor, apparently practising
a new step. Near the pines, forward left, General
Chadbourne turns from the butler, with whom he has
been speaking, to shake hands with some ladies. Later,
Ralph Ardsley appears just inside the door, forward
right, and holds up a glass of wine. Two or three<span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>

after another saunter past Ardsley into the side room.</i></p>

<span class="i0">I had a talent for it, so you said,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="ACT_IV" id="ACT_IV">ACT IV</a></h2>

<h2><small>THE LIVING MILL</small></h2>

<p><i>Scene: Inside the mill, showing in front a sort of
half storeroom, half office shut in from the main body
of the mill by a railing in the centre of which is a gate
that swings in and out. Far back in this main body
of the mill one sees a number of great gang saws from
which off-carriers, with freshly sawed slabs and lumber
upon their rollers, branch right from the main
line that runs the full length of the mill. Through an
opening in the far end, whence the logs are drawn up
an incline to the saws, one sees as through a telescope
a portion of the river and of the mountains on the
opposite bank. Up toward the front, left, in this main
body of the mill is a wide door that opens outside. In
the foreground, within the space partitioned off by the
railing, a pair of stairs, evidently connecting with the
outdoors on the ground floor, comes up rear left. Centre,
against this left wall, a pole six or eight inches in
diameter, and to all appearances only recently set, goes
up through a hole in the roof. Upon the floor at the
foot of the pole, from which two long ropes hang
down, lies a large American flag partially strung upon
the rope. Forward from the pole is a door which apparently
is no longer in use, a strip being nailed across<span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
it. About this end of the enclosure are piles of window
sash and kegs of nails. Centre rear, at right
angles to the side walls, so that one sitting upon a
stool may look back into the mill, is a long checkers'
desk with two or three stools before it and with the
usual litter of papers, books, and a telephone upon it.
In the right wall, rear, where one coming up the
stairs may walk straight on and enter, is a door connecting
with the main office.</i></p>

<p><i>As the Scene opens, something very important seems
to be going on in this main office. A crowd of men,
workmen and militiamen together, are packed about
the door, intent upon whatever it is that is transpiring
inside. Forward, away from the crowd, a small group,
mostly of militiamen, is gathered about two guards
with rifles in their hands, who have evidently just
come in. Back, beyond the railing and close to the
crowd, a group of workmen about Wes Dicey is engaged
in a heated argument. And farther back in the
mill, especially about the large door, left, are bodies of
men talking together. As the Scene opens, and for a
few minutes afterwards, some one up the pole is heard
singing.</i></p>

<p><i>Scene: Inside the large room of a newly built board
cabin up at the mine. Centre, rear, the open mouth
of the tunnel, with the wall resting upon the rocks
above. Left, in this same wall, near the corner, a door
opening outside. Right, near the other corner, about
four feet up from the floor, a small oblong window
through which one sees the snow lying thick upon the
mountains, and beyond the snow the dark of the sky
with the winter stars shining brightly. In the right
wall, well back, a door opens into a bedroom. Centre,
in the opposite wall, a second door opens into a sort
of woodshed. Left, a little way to the rear from the
centre of the room, a heavy iron stove with chairs
standing about. A woodbox is over near the wall, left.
Forward right, a table with a bugle lying upon two or
three sheets of loose paper, and, farther over, a heap of
ore samples in which, with the light of the near-by
lamp falling upon them, the gold is plainly visible.</i></p>

<p><i>Harvey Anderson, his hat pulled low over his eyes,
sits with his back to the bedroom, staring at the stove.
The only motion discernible is an occasional pressing
of the lip when he bites his moustache. Later, Mrs.
Egerton, careworn and evidently in deep distress, enters<span class="pagenum normal"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
